## Introduction
[*DomainEvents*](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimplyWorks.DomainEvents/) is a package that handles your events. When you dispatch an event, *DomainEvents* finds its relevant handlers and runs them. 
Define the relevant handles by writing classes that implement the **IHandle** interface from [PrimitiveTypes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimplyWorks.PrimitiveTypes/). 

## Getting Started 
To use *DomainEvents*, you will require the [`PrimitiveTypes`](https://github.com/simplify9/PrimitiveTypes) library.
